# FraudBusters - Phase 3A: Federated Learning with Blockchain

## Project Overview
This project explores advanced techniques to enhance credit card fraud detection. By leveraging the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, the aim is to compare the performance, complexity, and computational intensity of centralized machine learning models versus decentralized federated learning (using logistic regression). The federated learning phase of the project is then extended into two additional phases that investigate the benefits of integrating blockchain and zero knowledge proofs.

## Project Objectives
- To implement and evaluate a centralized logistic regression baseline for fraud detection.
- To distribute logistic regression training across multiple clients using federated learning.
- ***[This phase]*** To secure model updates in federated learning with blockchain technology.
- To enhance privacy in federated learning with zero knowledge proofs.
- To analyze and compare the accuracy, complexity, and computational intensity of each approach.

# Overview of Phase 3A (Federated Learning with Blockchain)

## Focus of This Phase
The objective of this phase is to implement a federated learning framework where model updates from clients are submitted to a blockchain. The blockchain ensures the integrity and transparency of the updates before they are aggregated to form a global model.

## Results and Interpretation

The global model, aggregated using federated learning and secured with blockchain, achieved notable results on the test set:

- **Accuracy: 99.17%** - High rate of correct predictions, though less informative in fraud detection due to class imbalance.
- **Precision: 15.75%** - Indicates a substantial number of false positives, highlighting the challenge of predicting fraudulent transactions.
- **Recall: 87.76%** - Successfully identified a significant portion of actual fraudulent transactions.
- **F1 Score: 0.2671** - Reflects the trade-off between precision and recall.
- **ROC AUC Score: 0.9547** - Excellent performance in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- **AUPRC: 0.7133** - Average precision across recall levels, useful for imbalanced datasets like fraud detection.

## Significance & Benfits of the Proof of Concept

This project demonstrates the successful integration of machine learning with blockchain, offering several key benefits:

- **Enhanced Data Integrity and Security**: Blockchain ensures that model updates cannot be tampered with once recorded.
- **Transparency and Traceability**: Provides a transparent record of all model updates, enabling accountability.
- **Decentralized Trust**: Eliminates the need for a central authority, fostering trust among all participants.
- **Immutability**: Ensures recorded updates cannot be altered or deleted, maintaining consistency.

## Dataset Description
**Dataset:** Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** 
    - The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
    - This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
    - It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, the original features and more background information about the data are not provided. 
    - Features `V1, V2, â€¦ V28` are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are `Time` and `Amount`.
- **Features:** 
  - `Time` Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
  - `V1-V28`: Principal components obtained with PCA.
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount.
  - `Class`: 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** 
  - Total transactions: 284,807
  - Fraudulent transactions: 492
  - Non-fraudulent transactions: 284,315

### Phase 2: Federated Learning using Logistic Regression
**Overview:** Implement federated learning to distribute model training across multiple clients. This simulates multiple clients (i.e. other financial institutions in this case) collaboratively training a machine learning model without sharing their sensitive data. This approach enhances data privacy while leveraging the collective knowledge from multiple sources. 
<br>

**High-level actions:**
- Split the dataset into multiple subsets for different clients.

- Aggregate model updates from clients.
- Evaluate the global model's performance.

### Phase 3A: Federated Logistic Regression with Blockchain
**Overview:**  Federated learning allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their data. Blockchain can enhance federated learning by providing a decentralized and immutable ledger for tracking contributions, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating secure model aggregation.
<br>

**High-level actions:**
- Set up a local blockchain using Ganache.
- Log model updates from each client on the blockchain.
- Aggregate updates securely.
- Evaluate the global model's performance.

### Phase 3B: Federated Logistic Regression using Zero Knowledge Proofs
**Overview:** Use zero knowledge proofs to enhance privacy in federated learning. In this phase, a federated machine learning model developed similar to that in Phase 2. Integrating zero-knowledge proofs with machine learning is also known as ZKML. 
<br>

ZKML allows for the secure and private verification of ML model computations. Essentially, ZKML enables one party to prove that a computation was performed correctly on private data without revealing the data itself or the details of the computation.
<br>

**High-level actions:**
